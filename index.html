                <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>
                <p>
                    Hi there, I’m Anolue Ekenedilichukwu Samuel but my close friends from home calls me Samba (my head shape), born on a Monday, 5th  February, in the Nineties. I’m from Ukpor in Nnewi South Local Government Area of Anambra State but currently residing in Ndufu-Echara, Ikwo Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, where I was deployed for the National Youth Service (NYSC). My place of Primary Assignment is Alex Ekwueme Federal University, Ndufu-Alike, under Establishment / SPATS (Senior Professional Administrative and Technical Staff) Unit, Registry Department. <br /> <br />
                    I graduated from University of Benin, Benin City, Nigeria where I studied Chemical Engineering. I learnt that “No one is Born a Developer” from my friends in school then that studied Computer Science and the passion of becoming a Full Stack Web Developer came from there. <br /> <br />
                    I have always been an achiever, be it academic or professional life or any field in my life. I believe in success through hard work and dedication. That is to say if you want something, work hard and you will achieve it, there is no short cuts. <br /> <br />
                    At the moment, I’m learning remotely with StartdotNg on Front End (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and Back End (Csharp).

                The production of Biodiesel from Jatropha Oil by transesterification method using homogeneous catalyst (NaOH) and the potential use of antimicrobial agents such as ethanol and extract from locally sourced Mitracarpus scaber for the prevention of biodeterioration of Biodiesel in storage was investigated in this study. Five Biodiesel samples under various treatment conditions (containing antimicrobial agents) and a control (without antimicrobial agents) were monitored for four to five (4 – 5) weeks for biodeterioration indicating physio - chemical parameters such as Acid value, Flash point and Fire point. Results obtained for the control experiment indicated biodeterioration of the Biodiesel sample. This was evident from the variation in the values of Acid value, Flash point and Fire point indicating the presence of microbial activity. Results obtained also showed that biodeterioration was mitigated when antimicrobial agents were introduced to the crude oil samples as seen in the stability in the values of Acid value, Flash point and Fire point. Of all the samples analysed, sample C containing 13 mL of Mitracarpus scaber extract performed best as evident from the almost constant values of Acid value, Flash point and Fire point, indicating the absence of microbial activity.
